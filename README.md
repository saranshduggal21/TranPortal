# TranPortal

## Inspiration:
I took the bus for almost 2 years, without the use of a phone and experience in taking the bus. 
As a young student, I had to travel to the various parts of the city of Brampton in order to complete my tasks and 
extracurriculars (volunteering, etc.). I saw a huge problem in the system the transit used to make the riders aware of 
the upcoming stops, which is why I decided to solve the problem for the numerous people out there who can still travel to 
wherever they would like too, without needing to rely on mobile devices or the poor communication between the 
transit stop awareness program and the riders. 

## What does it do?
The solution I created is called TranPortal, and it operates through LEDs and noises to represent the 
buses progress through its routes. The route of the bus is shown on a map with a representation of its route on it 
through LED lights representing the stops on the route. As the bus moves along, these lights would blink to show that 
the bus is approaching the stop and would stay on when the bus has passed the stop. 
The buzzer in the hardware also creates an auditory signal, a ringing sound to signal the bus approaching a stop.
